# 🧬 US_Covid19_Vaccine_Analysis_CountyLevel

A detailed Python-based analysis of COVID-19 vaccination trends across counties in the United States. This project investigates how demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors influence vaccination rates, aiming to support data-driven public health strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

With significant differences in COVID-19 vaccine uptake across U.S. counties, this study explores how factors such as income, education, race, age, healthcare access, and vaccine hesitancy correlate with vaccination trends. The project combines visual analytics, statistical techniques, and multiple public datasets to extract actionable insights.

## 📊 Key Analyses

- **National Vaccination Trends**  
  - High coverage in northeastern states  
  - Lower uptake in rural and southern regions

- **Demographic Disparities**  
  - Higher uptake in older age groups (65+)  
  - Lower rates among young adults and rural residents

- **Hesitancy Mapping**  
  - County-level hesitancy predictions visualized  
  - Urban areas show stronger follow-through

- **Visualization Highlights**  
  - Metro vs. Non-Metro comparison  
  - Vaccination by race, age, and gender  
  - State and county ranking plots

---

## 🔍 Insights & Findings

- Counties like **Santa Cruz (AZ)**, **Imperial (CA)**, and **Starr (TX)** exceed 95% vaccination.
- Urban counties outperform rural ones due to better outreach and infrastructure.
- Vaccine hesitancy is concentrated in specific rural and underserved regions.

---

## 📈 Future Scope

- Implement machine learning models to predict low-uptake regions
- Develop interactive dashboards for public health teams
- Apply sentiment analysis on social media to understand real-time hesitancy patterns
